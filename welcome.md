* Goal is 30-40% lecture/discussion 60-70% hands-on

## Internet

### Eduroam
Many academic (and some non-academic) institutions are a part of Eduroam. (See "List of Institutions" under "Members" at https://www.eduroam.us/ to find out if your institution is a member.) Please make sure you can log into Eduroam with your device at your home institution, which will make things easier once you come to UCD/UCSF.

If your institution is not a member of Eduroam, you can still access the open wireless through ["UCD Guest"](#ucd-guest-wireless) or ["UCSF guest"](#ucsf-guest-wireless).

### UCD Guest Wireless

You will need to access the UCSF wireless via your laptop to participate in the hands-on exercises. Please review http://itcatalog.ucdavis.edu/service/wireless-guest-access	for access instructions.

### UCSF Guest Wireless

You will need to access the UCSF wireless via your laptop to participate in the hands-on exercises. Please review https://it.ucsf.edu/services/ucsfguest-open-wireless for access instructions.
