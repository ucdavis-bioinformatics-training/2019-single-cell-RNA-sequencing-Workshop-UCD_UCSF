## Workshop Goals

* End to End understanding of RNAseq differential
  * Discussions/lectures
  * Technologies
  * Experimental design
  * Cost estimation
  * Workflow
  * mRNA gene expression analysis
* To work through a complete experiment, starting from raw data to completion, including making a few figures.
* Goal is 30-40% lecture/discussion 60-70% hands-on

## Internet

You will need to access the UCSF wireless via your laptop to participate in the hands-on exercises. Please review https://it.ucsf.edu/services/wireless-service for access instructions.

Many academic (and some non-academic) institutions are part of Eduroam. (See "List of Institutions" under
"Members" at https://www.eduroam.us/ to find out if your institution is a member.) Please make sure you
can log into Eduroam with your device at your home institution, which will make things easier once you come to UCSF.

If your institution is not a member of Eduroam, you can still access the open wireless through "UCSFguest".
